This Is the most Simple Image logger all you need is to run the File (Run it as admin otherwise it will not work)
Put in your Discord webhook
input the file Path to your image
It should make a New Folder Called Image in your Desktop and another folder with all the webhook config files (ONLY EDIT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING)
Enjoy your new image logger
